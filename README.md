# Resources
## Jupyter Hub
The hands-on activities will be hosted on a Dartmouth Jupyter Hub, so no installing any software on your local computer. Link to come. 
## Jamboard
We will keep track of shared ideas on this [Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1FddaYxYRI7g2lr-fmv1PaVITXFS3coO7MJdjMzZTYR8/edit?usp=sharing), a virtual whiteboard/sticky note wall for hybrid collaboration. 

# Schedule: 

The schedule is mostly set, with some talks for a CRREL site visit (for US citizens only :( ), and Friday's discussion order/schedule can be switched up depending on participant interests and schedules.
