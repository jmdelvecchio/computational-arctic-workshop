# Resources
## Jupyter Hub
~~The hands-on activities will be hosted on a Dartmouth Jupyter Hub, so no installing any software on your local computer (though stay tuned for the Doodleverse portion...). If you have a Dartmouth account, you can go to [jhub.dartmouth.edu](https://jhub.dartmouth.edu) and select "My Server" and then "Computational Arctic Workshop."~~
Never mind!!!

## Google Colab
Yes we have the notebooks running on Colab!!

# Schedule: 

The schedule is mostly set, with some talks for a CRREL site visit (for US citizens only :( ), and Friday's discussion order/schedule can be switched up depending on participant interests and schedules.
